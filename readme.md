# bundle-calc 
*calculate bundle size of your next project! ðŸ’»*

This is a simple web-app that given some node modules, outputs an estimate of the total size of all of them.

## Motivation
Sometimes I found myself wanting to decide on a set of libraries to use for my next front-end project, but I didn't find an easy way to estimate the bundle size of it given a set of libraries. Bundlephobia has something similar; but it requires us to upload a `package.json` file for that, which means we would have already set up our next project!
